# TODO:

1. `ds` to delete a segment in vim (camel or snake case segments)
2. LSP
3. Figure out how to use quickfix list (better than harpoon?)
4. Auto format code on save
5. token motion (dit, cit), and change definiton of word to ignore _ so that _ and - are treated equally
6. Better grep without having to type regex
7. Search a folder
