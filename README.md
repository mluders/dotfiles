# TODO:

* `ds` to delete a segment in vim (camel or snake case segments)
* LSP
* Figure out how to use quickfix list (better than harpoon?)
* Auto format code on save
* token motion (dit, cit), and change definiton of word to ignore _ so that _ and - are treated equally
* Better grep without having to type regex
* Grep same files as rg
* Search a folder
* Snippets, figure them out
* 'Julian/vim-textobj-brace' (it doesn't quite work as expected, make it work)
